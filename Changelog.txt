- Fixed: Conversion of tracks with a very large number of track points failed
  due to exceeding maximum command line length (32768 characters)
  -> "curl" now reads BRouter's URL from configuration file instead from command line
- BRouter is now running as separate thread improving BRouter and "curl" synchronization
  -> Tracks with a very large number of track points are converted much, much faster
- Fixed: BRouter log output was out of chronological order
